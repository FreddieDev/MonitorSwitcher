# MonitorSwitcher
A simple project I've made to switch my monitor's input from my work laptop to my desktop PC.

I often work faster on my desktop, however I need to use the work laptop for sensitive data.

## Setup
* Run script on laptop only (for brightness controlling)
* Edit the script's variables to use the correct input ints. These can be obtained by double clicking the script's taskbar icon
* Connect work laptop to desktop's display
* Set work laptop to duplicate screens mode
* (Optional recommended) use a script like [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) to control both devices with the same mouse and keyboard

## Features
* ALT+SHIFT+M to switch monitor inputs
* Dims work laptop whilst using desktop display
* Undims work laptop when using only laptop display
